How to do IPM/Kick Off/Desk Check

From my own understanding and experience:

Iteration Planning Meeting is a short but important meeting in the Software Development process.
It is done to determine which tasks and user stories are need to be done in the current iteration.
During the IPM, the team reviews items then chooses which items are to be done this iteration, and estimates the effort needed for these items.
In my experience, we give the user stories "points" based on how complicated the item is, or how long will it take to be done.
These tasks can also be assigned to team members during the IPM.

Kick Off in my understanding refers to the first ever meeting between the Developers Team, the Business Analyst, and the Client.
This is also officially the start of development for the project, as the team reviews requirements and assigns tasks to the team members.

QA Desk Check refers to a short meeting wherein the QA Analyst presents his/her findings while doing QA on the item or project. The team will then decide if the item is good to be deployed to production or further changes should be made.
